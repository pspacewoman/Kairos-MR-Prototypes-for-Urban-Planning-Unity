## 📖 Project Overview  
The **Unity Project** is a research initiative at **FernUniversität in Hagen**, aimed at developing an **Augmented Reality (AR) application** for collaborative learning and participatory urban planning.  

💡 The prototype explores how immersive technology can **enhance engagement, teamwork, and comprehension** in higher education and public forums.  

**My Role:** Unity AR Developer, HCI Research Assistant  
**Team:** PhD researchers, designers, artists, QA  
**Duration:** X months (202X)  
**Tools:** Unity · C# · XR Interaction Toolkit · Meta Quest SDK · GitHub · Agile  

---

## ❓ Problem Statement  
⚡ Traditional e-learning and urban planning tools lack **immersion** and **collaboration**.  
👩‍🎓 Students & citizens often struggle to stay engaged with 2D plans or hybrid learning models.  
➡️ Our goal: **Prototype an AR app** that makes collaborative learning and urban design **engaging, intuitive, and interactive**.  

---

## 🔍 Research & Insights  
✅ **Workshops Conducted:**  
- Held in multiple cities with students and citizens.  
- Tested AR app on **Meta Quest headsets**.  
- Findings: High engagement, improved comprehension with 3D interaction.  

---

## 🎨 Design Process (HCI / UCD Framework)  
🌀 Steps:  
1. Research (literature + user needs)  
2. Concept Development  
3. Prototyping in Unity  
4. Usability Testing (workshops)  
5. Refinement & Iteration  

---

## 🛠 Prototyping in Unity  
**Implementation Highlights:**  
- 📦 Interactive 3D AR overlay scenes  
- 🕹 Gesture + controller input (XR Interaction Toolkit)  
- 🔍 Marker detection via custom C# scripts  
- 📝 UI menus for Whiteboard · Draw · Input Equation  
- 🚀 Deployment on Meta Quest, WebGL & Desktop
