## 📖 About KAIROS Project

The **KAIROS Project** is a research initiative led by **FernUniversität in Hagen** in collaboration with municipal and industry partners.  
It explores how **Mixed Reality (MR)** and **cyber-physical systems** can enhance **citizen participation in urban planning**.

## 🔍 Initial Situation vs. 🎯 Goal

| **Initial Situation** | **KAIROS Goal** |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| Citizen participation often limited to **analog meetings** (info events, public evenings). | Combine **analog + digital participation** using MR technologies. |
| Planning **not on-site**; discussions abstract. | Enable **on-site, immersive visualization** via AR/MR. |
| Drafts are **hard to visualize, comment, or modify**. | Create **interactive 3D models** citizens can view, comment, and change in real time. |
| Citizens struggle to engage fully with static plans. | Support **human-centered, engaging participation** that improves collaboration. |
| 📄 Analog Meetings → 🗣️ Discussion → ❌ Limited Visualization → ⚡ Low Engagement | 📄 Analog Input → 💻 Automatic Digital 3D Model → 🥽 Mixed Reality On-Site → ✅ Interactive, Human-Centered Participation   |

## 📖 **Prototype Solution**
💡 The prototype explores how immersive technology can **enhance engagement, teamwork, and comprehension** in higher education and public forums.  
💡 **Prototype an AR app** that makes collaborative learning and urban design **engaging, intuitive, and interactive**.
