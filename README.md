The Unity Project is a research initiative at FernUniversität in Hagen, aimed at developing an Augmented Reality (AR) application for collaborative learning and training. The project combines Unity-based development with educational research to explore how immersive technology can enhance engagement in higher education.

1. Project Overview
The Unity Project explores how Augmented Reality (AR) can enhance collaborative learning in higher education. Developed as part of my role as Unity AR Developer at FernUniversität in Hagen, the project aimed to prototype immersive, interactive experiences for Meta Quest, WebGL, and desktop platforms.

My Role: Unity AR Developer, HCI Research Assistant
Team: PhD researchers, designers, artists, QA
Duration: X months (202X)
Tools: Unity, C#, XR Interaction Toolkit, Meta Quest SDK, GitHub, Agile

2. Problem Statement
Challenge: 
Traditional e-learning tools often lack immersion and collaboration. Students struggle to stay engaged in hybrid learning. The project sought to design an AR prototype that makes collaborative learning more engaging, intuitive, and interactive.

3. Research & Insights
✅ Workshops: 
- Two workshops held in different cities with students testing the AR app.
- High engagement & comprehension with 3D interaction

4. Design Process (HCI / UCD Framework)
🌀 Steps:
a. Research (literature + user needs)
b. Concept Development
c. Prototyping in Unity
d. Testing (workshops)
e. Refinement

5. Prototyping in Unity
🛠 Implementation Highlights:
a. Interactive 3D AR overlay scenes
b. Gesture + controller input (XR Interaction Toolkit)
c. Marker detection via custom C# scripts
d. UI menus for Create Whiteboard / Draw / Input Equation
e. Deployment on Meta Quest, WebGL, Desktop

6. Interaction Flow
🎮 Player Journey:
Player puts on headset → Whiteboard spawns → Chooses “Draw/Sketch” → Interacts with 3D content → Collaborates in shared space.

7. 📌 Testing & Evaluation
a. Workshops were conducted for usability testing of the MR prototypes.
b. Users valued visual learning & real-time teamwork.
c. Need for better onboarding & accessibility features.

8. Results & Contributions
a. Delivered a functional Unity AR prototype.
b. Demonstrated feasibility of AR in collaborative learning.
c. Produced scientific documentation and evaluation.
d. Opened path for future usability studies and curriculum integration.
