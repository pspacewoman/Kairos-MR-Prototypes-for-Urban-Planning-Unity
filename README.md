## 📖 About KAIROS Project

The **KAIROS Project** is a research initiative led by **FernUniversität in Hagen** in collaboration with municipal and industry partners.  
It explores how **Mixed Reality (MR)** and **cyber-physical systems** can enhance **citizen participation in urban planning**.  

### 🔹 Key Highlights
- Combines **digital + analog participation formats** for inclusive urban planning.  
- Uses **AR/MR applications** (Unity, XR Toolkit) to visualize redesigns of public spaces (e.g., Bad Berleburg marketplace).  
- Provides **low-threshold, accessible, and immersive interfaces** for citizens to interact with planning scenarios.  
- Leverages **cyber-physical components** for tangible interaction and real-time feedback.  
- Builds on expertise in **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **UX research**, and **MR prototyping**.  

💡 The prototype explores how immersive technology can **enhance engagement, teamwork, and comprehension** in higher education and public forums.  

**My Role:** Unity AR Developer, Scientific Research Assistant  
**Team:** PhD researchers, Designers, UI Artists, 
**Partners:** NetZFactor GmbH, 
**Duration:** X months (202X)  
**Tools:** Unity · C# · XR Interaction Toolkit · Meta Quest SDK · GitHub · Agile

## ❓ Problem Statement  
⚡ Traditional e-learning and urban planning tools lack **immersion** and **collaboration**.  
👩‍🎓 Students & citizens often struggle to stay engaged with 2D plans or hybrid learning models.  
➡️ Our goal: **Prototype an AR app** that makes collaborative learning and urban design **engaging, intuitive, and interactive**.  

---

## 🔍 Research & Insights  
✅ **Workshops Conducted:**  
- Held in multiple cities with students and citizens.  
- Tested AR app on **Meta Quest headsets**.  
- Findings: High engagement, improved comprehension with 3D interaction.

## 🎨 Design Process (HCI / UCD Framework)  
🌀 Steps:  
1. Research (literature + user needs)  
2. Concept Development  
3. Prototyping in Unity  
4. Usability Testing (workshops)  
5. Refinement & Iteration  

---

## 🛠 Prototyping in Unity  
**Implementation Highlights:**  
- 📦 Interactive 3D AR overlay scenes  
- 🕹 Gesture + controller input (XR Interaction Toolkit)  
- 🔍 Marker detection via custom C# scripts  
- 📝 UI menus for Whiteboard · Draw · Input Equation  
- 🚀 Deployment on Meta Quest, WebGL & Desktop
